## Description :label:

For the project CSS to the Resque it was my mission to make a firework show with Vanilla **CSS** and **HTML** ONLY, So the use of Javascript is not an option. The project is 3 firework shows made with only CSS, You can switch firework shows with tabs. 

---

## ToDoList

In addition from how it now looks, i still want to update the background of the firework shows, so you can see shows in different areas. I also want to upgrade the firework shows. 

- [ ] Background Art
- [ ] Upgrade the Shows
- [ ] Make flying flares
- [ ] Trigger each fire work flare
